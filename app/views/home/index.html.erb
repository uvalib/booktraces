   <h4>About</h4>
   <p>
      Many volumes in the circulating collections of Alderman Library have evidentiary value due to
      modifications by their former owners: marginalia, inserts, inscriptions and the like.
      Book Traces @ UVA is an effort to find these uniquely modified books, record their significant characteristics,
      and make them discoverable through the UVA Library catalog.
   </p>
   <h4 class="top-pad">Looking for booktraces.org?</h4>
   <p>
      Book Traces @ UVA grew out of Andrew Staufferâ€™s <a href="http://www.booktraces.org" target="_blank">Book Traces</a>,
      a website where anyone can submit pictures of unique copies of library books in circulating
      collections around the world.
      Have you found a book in your library with old writing on the pages or artifacts tucked in?
